bodega
======

Neo4J environment for performance measurements

This Project is part of an curricular activity of the course graphtheory(part of the B.Sc Information Systems @ Münster)
I'll use bodega to define the possibilities a graphdatabase could provide in the context of business process modeling.
Therefore i'll develop typical bpm-tool use-cases and measure their performance in contrast to an relational database.

The current setup consists of

* Springframework 3.2.1 RELEASE  
* SpringData 2.2.0 RELEASE
* Neo4J Server 2.0.0 M2 static-web running embedded
* HSQLDB 2.2.9 with Hibernate 4.19 file-based embedded
