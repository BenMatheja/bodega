Neo4J environment for performance measurements

This Project is part of an curricular activity of the course graphtheory(part of the B.Sc Information Systems @ MÃ¼nster)
I'll use bodega to define the possibilities a graphdatabase could provide in the context of business process modeling.
Therefore i'll develop typical bpm-tool use-cases and measure their performance in contrast to an relational database.
